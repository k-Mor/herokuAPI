The HDMI cable must be in the 'HDMI out' port in the document camera\n\n\u2691 Note that when booting up, the power light on the camera will flash red for about 3 seconds. After that, press the power button once and the light should turn green\n\n\u2691 Check the status of the power light. If it is amber or orange, check the switch on the right-side of the body, and ensure the little black switch is set to 'RGB.'\n\nIf all these things look in order, and you are still having trouble using your document camera, we may need to send out a building technician to your room.

You will also want to check the power switch on the device to ensure it is on. Lastly, if you have an additional power supply around, try that one to rule out supply issues\n\n\u2691 IF you are hearing a squealing sound or feedback, THEN: lower the microphone volume controls on the tower. You may also need to position the mic closer to your mouth. Finally, go to your Juno's settings and ensure that the 'Music Audio In' options is not checked. You can find that option in the 'Microphone Volume Screen.' \n\nIf none of these apply to you, or the steps did not address your concern, then we may need to send out your building technician.
